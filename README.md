# OurWorlds

Dear reader, you're probably wondering what this mysteriously sounding project called "OurWorlds" is. Allow me to describe it from the beginning.
OurWorlds originally started to take shape around 2014-2015. Initially, along with my friends, we decided to create an amateur text-based role-playing game ([PBF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play-by-post_role-playing_game)) that would take place through an online forum ([PBF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play-by-post_role-playing_game)). I was quite young at that time, but I was entrusted with the task of creating the forum based on the MyBB engine (which was quite advanced for those times). I had to take care of the server and website hosting, ensure the database was set up, and prepare the basic layout. From the original versions of the forum, not much remains, but we meticulously transferred our posts and role-playing threads. Many of them didn't survive to this day, but no one can take away the fun we had there. Ultimately, the forum still stands today, and as part of learning React, I decided to create something like a homepage, which you can see here in these projects. But still u can visit my forum.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
